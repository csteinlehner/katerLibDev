In case your library or tool requires 3rd party libraries, 
whoch need to be added to the distribution, put them into the lib folder. 
These 3rd party libraries will be added to your distribution 
and are located next to your library or tool jar file.

This does not apply to .jar files that are considered core processing libraries.
