# where is your processing sketchbook located? 
# if you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your
# processing preferences. (${user.home} points the compiler 
# to your home directory)

sketchbook.location=${user.home}/Documents/Processing



# (2) 
# where are the jar files located that are required for compiling 
# your library such as e.g. core.jar?
# by default the local classpath location points to folder libs
# inside eclipse's workspace (found in your home directory).

classpath.local.location=${user.home}/work/Coding/Eclipse/robotLib/extlib
#classpath.local.location=${user.home}

# for osx users. 
# the following path will direct you into processing's 
# application source code folder in case you put processing inside your
# Applications folder. uncommenting the line below will overwrite the 
# classpath.local.location from above.

# classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/


# add all jar files that are required for compiling your project
# to the local and project classpath, use a comma as delimiter.
# if you are making a tool, pde.jar besides core.jar is required.
# (pde.jar should then be located inside folder classpath.local.location)
# best practice would be to place both, core.jar and pde.jar into your local
# classpath location.

classpath.local.include=core.jar


# add processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# if you don't need to include the libraries folder to your classpath,
# comment out the following line.

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries



# (3) set the java version that should be used to compile your library.

java.target.version=1.5


# set the description of the ant build.xml file
ant.description=katerLib. ant build file.



# (4)
# project details.
# use library or tool as value for project.type

project.type=library
#project.type=tool


# give your project a name.
# if you are making a tool, then project.name must be the same as
# the name of the class that implements processing.app.tools.Tool

project.name=katerlib
#project.name=HelloWorld


# use normal or fast as value for project.compile 
# (fast will only compile the project into your sketchbook, 
# normal will compile the distribution including the 
# javadoc-reference and all web-files)

project.compile=normal
