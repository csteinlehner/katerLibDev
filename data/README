the data folder:
If your library or tool is using files like images, 
sound files, any data file, etc., put them into the data folder. 
When coding your library or tool you can use processing's 
internal loading functions like loadImage(), loadStrings(), etc. 
to load files located inside the data folder into your 
library or tool.
